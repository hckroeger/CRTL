/* vitest setup (happy-dom).

   1. location.ts wires the Home/Away pill at module-eval time, so the elements
      it grabs must exist before any module that transitively imports it loads.
   2. state.ts reads the bare `localStorage` global at module-eval time. In this
      env `window === globalThis` and happy-dom leaves no localStorage on it, so
      the global resolves to Node 22+'s experimental webstorage - which doesn't
      work and warns on *access*. Install a clean in-memory Storage instead.
      We only ever *assign* the global (never read it), so the experimental
      getter - and its warning - is never triggered. */
